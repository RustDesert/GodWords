I define x to be 5.
I define y to be 20.
I define n to be 2.

Oschon says: if y is greater than x, then,
  I define x to be 10.
  Also, I define y to be 54.
Thal says end.

Oschon then says: if not, 
  I define y to be 12.
Thal says end.

I declare n.

Nal says: while n is not identical to y,
  I add 1 to n.
Thal says end.

I declare n.
