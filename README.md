# GodWords
CSCI3200 Final Project by Sinuo Liu

This is basically a extension of the r2p.py file from canvas.

The language is consisted of two parts: "I", and other "Gods". 
This language is basically writting sign operators looks like English which we are using normally.
"I" can define variables, print variables without any other expressions such as if or while.
"Other Gods" have each roles within the language.
|Name|Function|
|---|---|
|Oschon|if statement and else statement|
|Nal|while statement|
|Thal|end the statement|

Currently operators only have:
|operator|Formate|
|---|---|
|x > y |x is greater than y|
|x < y |x is less than y|
|x >= y|x is greater or equal to y|
|x <= y|x is less or equal to y|
|x == y|x is identical to y|
|x != y|x is not identical to y|

Currently there are some bugs when I try to run Python3 godWords.py, but I can't figure out how to fix it.
