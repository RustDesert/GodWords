# GodWords
CSCI3200 Final Project by Sinuo Liu

This is basically a extension of the r2p.py file from canvas.

The language is consisted of two parts: "I", and other "Gods". 
"I" can define variables, print variables without any other expressions such as if or while.
"Other Gods" have each roles within the language.
|Name|Function|
|---|---|
|Oschon|if statement and else statement|
|Nal|while statement|
|Thal|end the statement|

Currently operators only have:
|operator|Formate|
|---|---|
|x > y |x is greater than y|
|x < y |x is less than y|
|x >= y|x is greater or equal to y|
|x <= y|x is less or equal to y|
|x == y|x is identical to y|
|x != y|x is not identical to y|

Currently there are some bugs when I try to run Python3 godWords.py, but I can't figure out how to fix it.
